# VisibilityExposureChange

In this example we will show you how you can get the visibility of a view element in Android when you scroll the screen, how to determine how much of a view is visible on the screen at given time, to follow the changes in visibility of the given view. This could be useful if you want to trigger some action when scrolling and you need the view will be fully visible, or maybe more than 50% visible, depending on your specific needs. This is especially useful if you are implementing MRAID 3.0 (Mobile Rich Media Ad Interface) exposure change. You can find this implementation on page 60 in the MRAID 3.0 documentation here -https://www.iab.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/MRAID_3.0_FINAL.pdf.
